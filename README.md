# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

This is a trivia application where you can play a trivia game. The application includes:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

## About the Stack

**SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
**PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
**Python3 and Flask** as our server language and server framework
**React.js** for our website's frontend


## Project Structure

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask and SQLAlchemy server. Endpoints have been defined in app.py, models for database and SQLAlchemy setup can be found in models.py. 

### Frontend
The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.

## Development Setup
To start and run the app please do the following:


#### Backend

- Please make sure that you installed all above-mentioned dependencies
- Cd into the backend folder and run:
  ```
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Run the development server:
  ```
  $ export FLASK_APP=flaskr
  $ export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
  $ flask run
  ```
- Test your endpoints and/or curl via [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)  


#### Frontend

- Again, make sure that you have all the dependencies installed ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

- Run npm install and npm run subsequently
- Run the development server:
  ```
